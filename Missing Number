# Missing Number 

## Problem Description
Given an array nums containing *n distinct numbers* taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n,  
find the *one number that is missing* from the array.


## Solution Explanation (Math Approach)

We use a simple trick with addition and subtraction to find the missing number.

1. Initialize result
- Start with res = len(nums) (this represents the extra index n).

 2. Iterate through array
- For each index i and element nums[i]:  
  - Add the index i to res  
  - Subtract the value nums[i] from res  

This ensures all numbers cancel out except the missing one.  

 3. Return result
- After the loop, res will hold the missing number.






Example

Input:
nums = [3,0,1]

Steps:

res = 3 (length of nums = 3)

i = 0 → res = 3 + 0 - 3 = 0

i = 1 → res = 0 + 1 - 0 = 1

i = 2 → res = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2


Output:
Missing Number = 2

Time & Space Complexity

Time: O(n) → single loop through array

Space: O(1) → only one variable res
