Longest Common Subsequence 

✅ Problem Statement

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS).

✔ What is a subsequence?

A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same order but not necessarily continuously.

Example:

text1 = "abcde"
text2 = "ace"
LCS = "ace"
Length = 3


---

🧠 Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

We use a DP table where
dp[i][j] represents:

> Length of LCS between text1[i:] and text2[j:].



DP Rules

If characters match:

dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j+1]

If characters don’t match:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])


The final answer is in:

dp[0][0]




🔍 Example

Input:
text1 = "abcba"
text2 = "abcbcba"

Output:
5

LCS = "abcba"

⏱ Time & Space Complexity

Complexity	Value

Time	O(n × m)
Space	O(n × m)


Where

n = len(text1)

m = len(text2)





🎯 Summary

Uses dynamic programming.

Builds a table from bottom to top.

Returns the LCS length efficiently.
