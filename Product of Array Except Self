Product of Array Except Self

Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all elements of nums except nums[i].

You must solve it without using division and in O(n) time.



Solution Explanation

The solution uses the prefix and suffix product approach:

1. Initialize an output array filled with 1.


2. Left pass:

Keep a running product left.

For each index i, set output[i] *= left.

Update left *= nums[i].

This ensures output[i] contains the product of all elements to the left of i.



3. Right pass:

Keep a running product right.

Traverse from right to left.

For each index i, set output[i] *= right.

Update right *= nums[i].

This ensures output[i] also includes the product of all elements to the right of i.



4. The final output array contains the product of all elements except the current index.






Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) – Two passes over the array.

Space Complexity: O(1) – Ignoring the output array, no extra space is used.
