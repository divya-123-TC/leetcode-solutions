 Course Schedule IV

 Problem Statement
You are given:
- *numCourses* → total number of courses (0 to n−1)
- *prerequisites* → list of pairs [a, b] meaning  
  *course a requires course b first*
- *queries* → list of pairs [u, v] asking:  
  👉 Is course **u* a prerequisite (direct or indirect) of course *v?

Your task is to return a list of booleans answering each query.

## 🧠 Key Idea

We need to find:
- *Direct prerequisites* (given)
- *Indirect prerequisites*  
  Example: if 0 → 1 and 1 → 2 then 0 → 2 is also True.

To solve this, we use a *transitive closure* approach (similar to Floyd–Warshall algorithm).

## ✔ Approach

### 1️⃣ Create a prerequisite matrix  
isPre[u][v] = True  
means u is a prerequisite of v.

### 2️⃣ Mark direct prerequisites  
From input [a, b] → mark isPre[a][b] = True.

### 3️⃣ Compute indirect prerequisites  
If:
- i → k is True  
- k → j is True  
Then:
- i → j becomes True

Meaning:  
i is an ancestor of k, and k is an ancestor of j → so i is ancestor of j

### 4️⃣ Answer queries  
For each query [u, v], return isPre[u][v].

📝 Example

Input:

numCourses = 4
prerequisites = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3]]
queries = [[0,3], [1,3], [3,0]]

Output:

[True, True, False]
