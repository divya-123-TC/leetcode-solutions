 Jump Game

### 🧠 Problem Summary
Given an array nums, where each value represents the maximum jump length from that index, determine whether you can reach the *last index* starting from index 0.

---

### 🧩 Approach — Greedy from Right-to-Left
We maintain the last reachable index (goal) and check if earlier indexes can reach it.  
If goal becomes 0, the answer is True.

### 🧠 Time & Space Complexity

| Case | Explanation | Time | Space |
|------|-------------|------|-------|
| Best Case | First index can already reach end | *O(1)* | O(1) |
| Average Case | Each element checked once | *O(n)* | O(1) |
| Worst Case | Need to check all elements | *O(n)* | O(1) |

✔ Single loop, extremely efficient  
✔ Ideal for interviews
