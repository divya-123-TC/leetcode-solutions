Path With Minimum Effort 
 Problem Statement
You are given a 2D grid heights where each cell represents the height of a location.  
You start from the *top-left cell (0,0)* and must reach the *bottom-right cell (rows-1, cols-1)*.

 Allowed moves
You may move *up, down, left, or right*.

Effort of a move
Moving from cell (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) has effort:

effort = abs(heights[x1][y1] - heights[x2][y2])

 Path Effort
The *effort of a path* is:

maximum effort taken in any single step of the path.

 Goal
Find the *path from start to end* where the *maximum step effort* is as *small as possible*.

 Example

*Input:*

[[1,2,2], [3,8,2], [5,3,5]]

*Output:*

2

*Explanation:*  
The best path minimizes the maximum height difference.  
One such optimal path gives a maximum step difference of *2*.

## 🚀 Approach — Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm

This problem cannot be solved using regular BFS or DFS because:
- We are not minimizing sum of steps.
- We are minimizing the *maximum step* in the path.

### Why Dijkstra?
Dijkstra normally finds the shortest path based on sum of weights.  
Here, we modify it to store:

effort_so_far = maximum difference along the path

For each neighbor:

new_effort = max(effort_so_far, step_difference)

We always expand the path with the *minimum possible maximum effort* first.

### Key Points
- Use a *min-heap* (effort, row, col)
- Use a dist[][] matrix to store the *best (minimum) effort* to reach each cell.
- Stop when bottom-right cell is popped from the heap.
