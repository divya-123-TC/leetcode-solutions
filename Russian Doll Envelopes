 Russian Doll Envelopes

📝 Problem Statement

You are given a list of envelopes.
Each envelope has width and height: (w, h)
You can put an envelope into another only if:

w1 < w2 AND h1 < h2

Find the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested (Russian doll style).

🔍 Example

Input:

[[5,4], [6,4], [6,7], [2,3]]

Output:

3

Explanation:

(2,3) → (5,4) → (6,7)


---

💡 Approach (Optimal)

1️⃣ Sort envelopes by:

width ascending

if width same → height descending


2️⃣ Take only heights
3️⃣ Find Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) in heights
4️⃣ LIS length = answer ✔


---

🧠 Why descending height when same width?

To avoid wrongly counting envelopes with same width as valid nestings.

Example:

(6,4) and (6,7) cannot nest because width same
