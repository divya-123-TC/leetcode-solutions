Minimum Path Sum

 Problem Statement

Given a grid (matrix) of non-negative integers, start from top-left and reach bottom-right by moving only:

➡ Right

⬇ Down


Find the minimum path sum.


---

 Example

Grid:

1 3 1
1 5 1
4 2 1

Minimum path:

1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 = 7


---

 Concept

We use Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up).

At every cell (r, c):

best_path = grid[r][c] + min(path_down, path_right)

We fill values starting from bottom-right → top-left.


 DP Table Idea

Create a table 1 row + 1 column extra, filled with infinity.

Set the extra bottom-right cell to 0.

This avoids out-of-bounds errors.



 Final Answer

After filling everything,
👉 res[0][0] will contain the minimum path sum.




 Key Points

Only right and down moves allowed.

Use min() to select cheaper path.

Extra row/column prevents boundary issues.

Start filling from bottom-right.



-⭐ Quick Formula

res[r][c] = grid[r][c] + min(res[r+1][c], res[r][c+1])
