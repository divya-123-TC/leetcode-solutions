Word Ladder
 Problem Statement

You are given:

beginWord: the starting word

endWord: the target word

wordList: a list of valid words


In one step, you can change exactly one letter, and each new word must exist in the wordList.

Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.


2. Each transformed word must exist in the wordList.



If there is no valid transformation sequence, return 0.

🧠 Example

Input:

beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:

5

Explanation:

hit → hot → dot → dog → cog

The shortest transformation sequence length is 5.


---

💡 Approach

We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) because it finds the shortest path first.

To efficiently find words that differ by only one letter,
we generate intermediate patterns by replacing each letter with *.

For example:

"hot" → "ot", "h*t", "ho"

If two words share a pattern, they are neighbors (can transform into each other in one step).

🧩 Algorithm Steps

1. Check if endWord exists in the word list.
If not, return 0.


2. Build a pattern map (dictionary):

For each word, create patterns by replacing each letter with *.

Example:
"dog" → og, d*g, do

Store all words matching the same pattern together.



3. Perform BFS (Level-by-Level Search):

Start with beginWord in a queue.

For each word, check all one-letter patterns.

Visit all new words (not already visited).

If endWord is found, return the number of levels (steps).



4. If BFS finishes without finding endWord, return 0.




 Example Walkthrough

Step	Queue Contents	Current Word	Next Words Found	Path Length

1	["hit"]	hit	hot	1
2	["hot"]	hot	dot, lot	2
3	["dot","lot"]	dot → dog, lot → log	dog, log	3
4	["dog","log"]	dog → cog ✅	cog	4
5	["cog"]	Found endWord	-	5


✅ Output = 5

🕒 Time & Space Complexity

Type	Complexity	Explanation

⏰ Time	O(N × L²)	N = number of words, L = word length (pattern generation + BFS)
💾 Space	O(N × L)	For storing patterns and queue data
