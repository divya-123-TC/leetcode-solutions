#SET MATRIX ZEROES


Problem Description

Given an m x n matrix, if any element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place with minimal extra space.




Solution Explanation

1. Check first row and first column

See if the first row contains any zero → remember it

See if the first column contains any zero → remember it



2. Use first row & column as markers

For every other cell:

If the cell is 0, mark its row in the first column and column in the first row




3. Set zeros using markers

For every cell except the first row and column:

If its row or column is marked → set it to 0




4. Handle first row

If the first row originally had a zero → set all its cells to 0



5. Handle first column

If the first column originally had a zero → set all its cells to 0






Time & Space Complexity

Time: O(m × n) → Two passes over the matrix

Space: O(1) → Only first row and column used as markers
