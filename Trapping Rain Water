Trapping Rain Water

Problem Statement

Given an array height[] representing elevation bars, find how much water can be trapped after raining.



 Approach (Two Pointers)

1. Initialize two pointers:

left = 0, right = n-1

left_max = height[left], right_max = height[right]



2. While left < right:

If left_max < right_max:

Move left pointer → update left_max.

Add trapped water: left_max - height[left].


Else:

Move right pointer → update right_max.

Add trapped water: right_max - height[right].




3. Continue until pointers meet.


4. Return total trapped water.






 Dry Run Example

Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

Step by step:

Water trapped at each index = [0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0]

Total = 6


Output: 6




⏱ Complexity

Time: O(n) → each index processed once.

Space: O(1) → only variables used.
