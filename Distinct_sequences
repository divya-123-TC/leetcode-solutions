Distinct Subsequences

 Problem Summary
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

A subsequence means deleting characters without changing order.

Approach

We use recursion + memoization (Dynamic Programming).

At each position:

- If characters match → two choices:
  - Use the character
  - Skip the character
- If not match → skip character

We store results in a cache to avoid recomputation.



##  Time Complexity
O(m × n)

##  Space Complexity
O(m × n)
