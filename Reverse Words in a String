Reverse Words in a String 


 Problem Statement
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.  

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.  
- The words in s will be separated by at least one space.  
- The result string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, and words should be separated by a single space.  

### Example 1
*Input:*  
s = "the sky is blue"  
*Output:*  
"blue is sky the"

### Example 2
*Input:*  
s = "  hello   world  "  
*Output:*  
"world hello"

### Example 3
*Input:*  
s = "a good   example"  
*Output:*  
"example good a"

---

 Approach
1. Use Python’s split() method to break the string into words.  
   - It automatically removes extra spaces (leading, trailing, and multiple spaces between words).  
2. Reverse the list of words using reverse().  
3. Join the reversed words back into a string using " ".join(...).  

 Complexity
- *Time Complexity:* O(n) where n = len(s)  
  - Splitting, reversing, and joining each take linear time.  
- *Space Complexity:* O(n)  
  - Extra space is required for storing the words list.



 Example Run

Input:
s = "  the sky   is blue  "

Step-by-step:

After split() → ["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]

After reverse() → ["blue", "is", "sky", "the"]

After " ".join() → "blue is sky the"


Output:
"blue is sky the"
