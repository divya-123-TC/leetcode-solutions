Coin Change Problem (Dynamic Programming)

🧩 Problem Statement

You are given:

A list of coin denominations coins

A target value amount


Your task is to find the minimum number of coins required to make the given amount using unlimited coins of each denomination.

If the amount cannot be formed using any combination of the coins, return -1.

🎯 Example

Input:

coins = [1, 2, 5]
amount = 11

Output:

3

Explanation:
11 can be made using three coins → 5 + 5 + 1.

🧠 Approach: Dynamic Programming

We use a 1D DP array where:

dp[x] = minimum number of coins needed to make amount x.

Steps:

1. Initialize the DP array with a large value (amount + 1) meaning "impossible".


2. Set dp[0] = 0 because 0 coins are needed to make amount 0.


3. For each amount from 1 to amount, try every coin.


4. Update the dp table using:

dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])


5. Finally, check:

If dp[amount] changed → return it

Else → return -1
