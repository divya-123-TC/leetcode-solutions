# Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the **product of all elements of nums except nums[i]`.  

You must solve it *without using division* and in *O(n)* time.



## Solution Explanation

We cannot use division, so we use *prefix and suffix products*:

### Steps:

1. *Initialize*
   - Create an output array res filled with 1.

2. *Left Pass (prefix product)*
   - Keep a variable left = 1.
   - Traverse left → right.
   - For each index i:
     - Set res[i] *= left → store product of all elements to the left.
     - Update left *= nums[i].

3. *Right Pass (suffix product)*
   - Keep a variable right = 1.
   - Traverse right → left.
   - For each index i:
     - Set res[i] *= right → multiply with product of all elements to the right.
     - Update right *= nums[i].

4. *Result*
   - After both passes, res[i] contains product of all elements except nums[i].



## Complexity Analysis
- *Time Complexity:* O(n) → Two passes over the array.  
- *Space Complexity:* O(1) → Ignoring the output array, no extra space is used.
