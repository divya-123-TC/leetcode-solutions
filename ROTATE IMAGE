Problem Description

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise in-place (no extra space).



Solution Explanation

1. Transpose the matrix

Swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i] for all i < j

This flips the matrix over its diagonal



2. Reverse each row

After transposing, reverse every row to complete the 90° clockwise rotation




Key Idea:

Transpose converts rows to columns

Reverse rows to rotate clockwise





Example

Input:

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

After transpose:

[[1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [3,6,9]]

After row reverse:

[[7,4,1],
 [8,5,2],
 [9,6,3]]


Time & Space Complexity

Time: O(n²) → Visit every element twice

Space: O(1) → In-place, no extra array
