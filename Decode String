 Decode String 

Problem Statement

Given an encoded string, return its decoded form.

Encoding rule: k[encoded_string] → repeat the string inside brackets k times.

Example:

Input: "3[a2[c]]"

Output: "accaccacc"





🧠 Approach

Use a stack to process characters.

For each character:

If not ] → push into stack.

If ] →

1. Pop characters until [ to form substring.


2. Pop digits to get repeat count k.


3. Push back k * substring.




Finally, join all stack items into the decoded string.



        

⏱ Complexity

Time: O(n) → each char processed at most twice (push + pop).

Space: O(n) → stack holds characters and substrings.
