Word Break 



## Problem Statement

Given a string s and a list of words wordDict, determine if s can be segmented into a sequence of one or more words from the dictionary.

### Example

*Input:*

s = "leetcode" wordDict = ["leet", "code"]

*Output:*

True

Explanation: "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".



## Approach

We use *Dynamic Programming (DP)* with a bottom-up approach.

- Define dp[i] → True if the substring s[0:i] can be segmented using words from wordDict.
- Initialize:
  - dp[0] = True (empty string is always valid).
- Transition:
  - For each position i in the string:
    - Check all words w in wordDict.
    - If the substring s[i-len(w):i] matches w and dp[i-len(w)] is True, then set dp[i] = True.
- The answer is dp[len(s)].





Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n × m × k)

n = length of string s

m = number of words in wordDict

k = average length of words


Space Complexity: O(n) for the dp array.
