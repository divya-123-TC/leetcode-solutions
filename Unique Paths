 Unique Paths


🧩 Problem Overview

You are given a grid of size m × n.
A robot starts at the top-left corner and can move only:

➡ Right

⬇ Down


Your task is to compute the total number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner.

🎯 Core Insight

To reach a cell (r, c), the robot can come from:

the left cell (r, c-1)

the top cell (r-1, c)


Thus, the number of paths follows the DP relation:

dp[r][c] = dp[r][c - 1] + dp[r - 1][c]

🚀 Space Optimization Strategy

Instead of creating the full DP matrix (m × n), observe:

The current row depends only on the previous row.

So we maintain:

aboveRow → the row above

currentRow → the row being computed



Both arrays are of size n.

🧠 Why Initialize Rows with All 1s?

Every row starts with 1s because:

First row: only horizontal (right) moves → 1 way to reach each cell

First column: only vertical (down) moves → always 1 way


Initializing with [1] * n ensures:

First column is correct

Other columns get updated using the DP formula



🔍 Example: m = 3, n = 4

Row 0: 1 1 1 1
Row 1: 1 2 3 4
Row 2: 1 3 6 10

Final Answer: 10 unique paths

🏁 Summary

Movement allowed only right/down → simple combinatorial grid.

Each cell depends on left + top (classic DP pattern).

Space optimized using single-row rolling array.
