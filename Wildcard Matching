 Wildcard Matching

🧠 Problem Summary

Match string s with pattern p where:

Pattern	Meaning

?	Match exactly one character
*	Match zero or more characters


Goal → Entire string must match completely.


---

🧩 Approach — Recursion + Memoization + * Optimization

✔ Remove consecutive stars: "" → ""
✔ Use DP with memo to avoid repeated work
✔ Each state (i, j) computed once


---

🧠 Complexity Analysis

Let:

n = len(s)

m = len(p) after removing consecutive *


Case	Explanation	Time	Space

Best Case	Simple exact match or quick mismatch	O(n)	O(n+m)
Average Case	Most pattern matches use memo	O(n × m)	O(n × m)**
Worst Case	Many valid wildcard paths	O(n × m)	O(n × m)**


📝 DP memo ensures recursion does not explode into exponential paths.
