Jump Game II

🔹 Problem Summary
You are given an integer array nums, where each element represents the *maximum jump length* from that index.

Starting at index 0, return the *minimum number of jumps* required to reach the *last index*.

You can always reach the last index.

 Example 1

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4] Output: 2 Explanation: Jump from 0 → 1 → 4 (end)

### Example 2

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4] Output: 2

## 💡 Approach — Greedy (Optimal)
We explore jumps *level by level*, like BFS:

- l and r mark the *current reachable range*
- From that range, pick the *farthest* index we can reach next
- That counts as *one jump*
- Continue until we reach the last index

This ensures *minimum jumps* are taken.

## ⏱ Complexity

| Type | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Time | *O(n)* — one full scan |
| Space | *O(1)* — no extra memory |

🔥 Best performance — Perfect for interviews!


 Key Takeaways

Always move to the index that lets you reach the farthest

This greedy technique gives minimum jumps

Similar thinking to BFS, but without extra memory
