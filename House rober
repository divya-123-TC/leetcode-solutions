Problem Statement

You are given an array nums where each element represents the amount of money in a house.
You are a thief planning to rob houses, but you cannot rob two adjacent houses.
Your goal is to return the maximum money you can rob without alerting the police.

💡 Intuition

At every house, you have two choices:

1. Skip the current house → keep the money you already have (max_rob)


2. Rob the current house → take its money + best money from two houses before (prev_rob + cur_val)



Choose whichever gives more money.

🧠 Explanation of Variables

prev_rob → Best money if you robbed up to house i−2

max_rob → Best money if you robbed up to house i−1

cur_val → Money in the current house

temp → Best money at the current step


We update values as we move through the houses.

🔁 Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

1. Start with prev_rob = 0 and max_rob = 0


2. Loop through each house value:

Calculate the best choice:

temp = max(max_rob, prev_rob + cur_val)

Update:

prev_rob = max_rob
max_rob = temp



3. After the loop, return max_rob as the final answer.

🧮 Dry Run Example

Input:

nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]

House	Value	prev_rob	max_rob	Best Choice

1	2	0	0 → 2	Rob
2	7	2	2 → 7	Rob
3	9	7	7 → 11	Rob
4	3	11	11 → 11	Skip
5	1	11	11 → 12	Rob


✅ Final Answer: 12
