Stone Game
📌 Problem Statement

Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones arranged in a row.

The number of piles is even

Each pile contains a positive number of stones

Alice starts first

In each turn, a player picks stones from either the leftmost or rightmost pile

Both players play optimally

 Return true if Alice wins the game, otherwise false.

 Approach (Dynamic Programming)

We use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem.

Key Idea

Let
dp[i][j] = maximum score difference (current player − opponent)
when playing with piles from index i to j.

If dp[i][j] > 0, the current player can win

Alice starts first, so we check dp[0][n-1]

⚙️ Algorithm

Create a 2D DP table dp[n][n]

Base case:

When i == j, only one pile exists

So, dp[i][i] = piles[i]

For longer ranges:

Player can choose left or right pile

Choose the option that maximizes score difference

Formula
dp[i][j] = max(
    piles[i] - dp[i+1][j],
    piles[j] - dp[i][j-1]
)

🧪 Example

Input:

piles = [5, 3, 4, 5]


Output:

true


Alice can always collect more stones than Bob.



⏱️ Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(n²)

✅ Final Result

If dp[0][n-1] > 0 → Alice wins

Return true

📝 Note

Although this DP solution works perfectly, LeetCode 877 also has a mathematical shortcut where Alice always wins. However, this DP approach is useful for interviews and learning game theory DP problems.
