Asteroid Collision

 Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers asteroids.

Each asteroid’s absolute value represents its size.

The sign represents its direction:

Positive → moving right

Negative → moving left



Rules:

When two asteroids collide (right vs left), the smaller one explodes.

If they are the same size, both explode.

If they move in the same direction, they never collide.


Return the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

 Approach (Stack Based)

1. Use a stack (res) to keep track of surviving asteroids.


2. For each asteroid a:

If a moves left and last asteroid in stack moves right → collision occurs.

Compare their sizes using -a (size of negative asteroid).

Cases:

If -a > res[-1] → current asteroid wins, pop the last one.

If -a == res[-1] → both destroyed.

If -a < res[-1] → current asteroid destroyed.


If no collision, push a into stack.



3. Return the stack.







 Dry Run Example

Input: [5, 10, -5]

res = []

Add 5 → [5]

Add 10 → [5, 10]

-5 comes → collision with 10: 10 > 5 → -5 destroyed.


Output: [5, 10]




⏱ Complexity

Time: O(n) → each asteroid pushed/popped once.

Space: O(n) → stack may hold all asteroids in worst case.
