Median of Two Sorted Arrays


Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, find the median of the combined array.

Median → middle value (or average of two middle values if total length is even)





Solution Explanation

1. Merge the arrays

Combine nums1 and nums2 into a single array

Sort the merged array



2. Check total length

If total length is even → median is average of two middle elements

If total length is odd → median is the middle element



3. Return the median

Use integer division and indexing to find the middle element(s)







Example

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Merged: [1,2,3] → Median: 2

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Merged: [1,2,3,4] → Median: (2+3)/2 = 2.5




Time & Space Complexity

Time: O((m+n) log(m+n)) → Sorting after merging

Space: O(m+n) → Merged array
