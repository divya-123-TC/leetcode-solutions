Merge K Sorted Lists
Problem Summary

Given k sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list.

 Approach (Min Heap)

At every step, we need the smallest node among k lists.
We use a min heap (priority queue).

Steps:

Push first node of each list into heap.

Pop smallest node.

Attach to result.

Push next node of same list.

Repeat until heap is empty.



Complexity

Time: O(N log k)

Space: O(k)

Where:

N = total number of nodes

k = number of lists
