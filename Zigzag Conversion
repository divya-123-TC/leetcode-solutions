 Zigzag Conversion 

Problem Statement
The string s is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows (numRows) and then read row by row.

For example, given s = "PAYPALISHIRING" and numRows = 3, the zigzag pattern looks like this:

P   A   H   N A P L S I I G Y   I   R

Reading row by row gives:  
*Output:* "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"


 Approach
We simulate the zigzag writing process:

1. Maintain an array of lists rows where each row stores its characters.  
2. Traverse the string s character by character.  
3. Use a pointer idx to track the current row, and d (direction) to know whether we are moving *down* or *up*.  
   - If we’re at the *top row, change direction to **down*.  
   - If we’re at the *bottom row, change direction to **up*.  
4. Append characters to the appropriate row.  
5. Finally, join all rows together to form the result.



 Complexity
- *Time Complexity:* O(n) where n = len(s)  
  Each character is visited once.  
- *Space Complexity:* O(n)  
  Extra storage is used for rows before joining.



 Example Run

Input:
s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4

Zigzag Pattern:

P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I

Output:
"PINALSIGYAHRPI
