 Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values â€”
i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level, and alternate between.

ðŸ”¹ Example:

Input:

3
     / \
    9  20
      /  \
     15   7

Output:

[[3],[20,9],[15,7]]


---

ðŸ”¹ Approach:

This is a modified level order traversal:

1. Perform BFS using a queue (like problem 102).


2. Keep a boolean flag left_to_right to track traversal direction.


3. For each level:

Collect node values in a list.

Reverse the list if direction is right-to-left.



4. Toggle the direction after every level.

ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(N)



---

ðŸ”¹ Key Idea:

Alternate between normal and reversed order after each level to achieve a zigzag pattern.
