Maximal Square 
📌 Problem Description

You are given a 2D binary matrix filled with '0' and '1'.
Your task is to find the largest square containing only 1s
and return its area.

📝 Example

Input:

matrix =
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]

Output:

4

Explanation: The largest square of 1s has side length = 2, so area = 2 × 2 = 4.

🧠 Key Idea (Top-Down DP with Memoization)

We use a recursive function helper(r, c) that returns:

> The side length of the largest square starting at position (r, c)



For each cell:

If it is '1', then the square size depends on:

down → (r+1, c)

right → (r, c+1)

diagonal → (r+1, c+1)



We take:

1 + min(down, right, diag)

If cell is '0', value = 0.

We store every result in cache to avoid recalculation → Memoization.

⏳ Complexity Analysis

Approach	Time Complexity	Space Complexity

Top-down DP + Memo	O(m × n)	O(m × n)


Where m = rows, n = columns


 Summary

✔ We compute the maximum possible side length of a square from each cell
✔ Return the largest area = side²
✔ Efficient because of memoization
✔ Very clean recursive DP approach
