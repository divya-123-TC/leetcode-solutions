Find Median from Data Stream

##  Problem Statement

Design a data structure that supports the following operations:

- `addNum(int num)` → Adds a number into the data structure.
- `findMedian()` → Returns the median of all elements so far.

The numbers are added one by one (like a stream of data).
 What is Median?

Median is the middle value after sorting the numbers.

- If total numbers are odd → return middle number.
- If total numbers are even → return average of two middle numbers.

### Example:

Input:
```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() → 1.5
addNum(3)
findMedian() → 2
```

## 🚀 Optimal Approach – Two Heaps

To efficiently calculate the median:

- Use **Max Heap** → to store smaller half of numbers
- Use **Min Heap** → to store larger half of numbers

### Why Two Heaps?

Because median divides numbers into two equal halves.

We maintain:

- All elements in max heap ≤ elements in min heap
- Size difference between heaps ≤ 1



## 🔍 How It Works

1. Always insert new number into max heap (as negative).
2. Move the largest number from max heap to min heap.
3. Balance sizes so that max heap has equal or one more element.
4. If total numbers are odd → median = top of max heap.
5. If total numbers are even → median = average of tops of both heaps.
