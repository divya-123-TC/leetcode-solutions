Partition Equal Subset Sum

## 🔹 Problem Summary
You are given an integer array nums.  
Your task is to determine whether the array can be *split into two subsets* such that:

✔ Both subsets have *equal sum*  
✔ Every element must be used in one subset

---

### 🧠 Key Insight
If the *total sum* of array elements is *odd*,  
then it is *not possible* to divide it into two equal parts.

If the sum is *even*,  
we check if there exists a *subset* with sum = total_sum / 2.

This becomes a *Subset Sum Problem*.

### 🧪 Examples

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5] Output: true Explanation: 1 + 5 + 5 = 11 and remaining subset = 11

#### Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5] Output: false Explanation: total = 11 → cannot split equally

## 💡 Approach — Dynamic Programming with Set

We keep a set dp that stores all possible subset sums seen so far.  
For each number:
- We try including it → update possible sums
- Check if we reached target early → return True

This avoids full DP table → memory efficient!

## ⏱ Complexity

| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| Time | *O(n × target)* worst case |
| Space | *O(target)* using set |

💡 Faster in practice due to early return True 💡

 Key Takeaways

This is a Subset Sum problem

Convert problem to:
→ Can we make sum(nums) // 2 using some elements?

Use set DP for better space usage

Very common interview question
