 Critical Connections in a Network

Problem Statement

You are given:

An integer n representing the number of nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1

A list of undirected edges connections[i] = [u, v]


A critical connection (also called a bridge) is an edge which, if removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.

Your task is to return all critical connections in the network.


 Intuition

This is a classic graph problem: finding bridges in an undirected graph.

A bridge is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph.

We use Tarjan’s Algorithm, which uses DFS and two key arrays:

disc[u] → Discovery time of node u

low[u] → The lowest discovery time reachable from node u using:

Zero or more DFS edges (children)

At most one back-edge



An edge (u, v) is a critical connection if:

low[v] > disc[u]

This means v (and its subtree) cannot reach back to u or any ancestor of u.

🧠 Approach

1. Build adjacency list for the graph


2. Maintain:

disc[] → to check if a node is visited

low[] → lowest reachable node

time → global clock for discovery order



3. Start DFS from node 0


4. For each neighbor:

If not visited → DFS deeper

Update low-link values on return

Check if bridge using the Tarjan condition



5. Return all bridges collected

🧩 Algorithm

Use DFS traversal

Track discovery & low values

A bridge exists when low[child] > disc[parent]





📈 Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity:

O(n + m)
Where:

n = number of nodes

m = number of edges


Each node and edge is visited once.

Space Complexity:

O(n + m) for:

Graph adjacency list

DFS recursion stack

disc and low arrays

📝 Example

Input

n = 4
connections = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,0], [1,3]]

Output

[[1,3]]

Explanation: Removing edge 1–3 disconnects node 3.
