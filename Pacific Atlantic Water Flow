 Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

### 🧩 Problem Statement
You are given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers called heights, where heights[r][c] represents the height of a cell.  

Water can flow from a cell to another cell if it is *next to it (up, down, left, or right)* and its height is *less than or equal* to the current cell's height.  

- The *Pacific Ocean* touches the *top and left* edges of the matrix.  
- The *Atlantic Ocean* touches the *bottom and right* edges.

Return a list of all coordinates where water can flow to *both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans*.

### 💡 Example
*Input:*
```python
heights = [
  [1,2,2,3,5],
  [3,2,3,4,4],
  [2,4,5,3,1],
  [6,7,1,4,5],
  [5,1,1,2,4]
]

Output:

[[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]

Explanation:
Cells like (3,0) and (1,4) can flow to both the Pacific (top/left) and Atlantic (bottom/right) oceans.

⚙ Approach (Simple DFS)

Instead of starting from every cell, we reverse the problem:

1. Start DFS from ocean borders:

From the Pacific (top row & left column)

From the Atlantic (bottom row & right column)



2. During DFS, only move to a neighbor if its height is greater than or equal to the current cell’s height.


3. Keep track of visited cells for each ocean using two sets:

pacific

atlantic



4. Finally, the answer = cells that are present in both sets.

🧠 Intuition

We simulate water flow backward — instead of water flowing down to the ocean, we let the ocean "climb up" to all reachable cells that can flow into it.
Each cell reachable by both oceans is part of the final answer.

⏱ Time and Space Complexity

Type	Complexity	Explanation

Time	O(m * n)	Each cell is visited at most twice (once per ocean)
Space	O(m * n)	For recursion stack and visited sets

🧾 Key Points

DFS from ocean borders instead of every cell.

Reverse flow: move only to equal or higher heights.

Simple and clean — works efficiently even for large grids.

Alternative

You can also use BFS (Queue) instead of DFS to avoid recursion depth issues, but the logic remains the same.
