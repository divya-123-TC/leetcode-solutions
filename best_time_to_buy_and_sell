You may complete at most **2 transactions**.

Return the maximum profit.

A transaction = Buy + Sell.

---
 Approach

We track four states:

- `buy1`  → Maximum profit after first buy  
- `sell1` → Maximum profit after first sell  
- `buy2`  → Maximum profit after second buy  
- `sell2` → Maximum profit after second sell  

We update these values for each price.
