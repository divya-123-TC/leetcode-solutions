Shortest Path in Binary Matrix 
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
The goal is to find the shortest path from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner, moving through cells with value 0, and movement is allowed in eight directions.

Problem Description

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where:

0 means the cell is open

1 means the cell is blocked

Your task is to return the length of the shortest clear path, starting at (0,0) and ending at (n-1,n-1).

A clear path means:

Every visited cell must be 0

Movement is allowed in 8 directions: up, down, left, right, and all diagonals

If no valid path exists, return -1.

🎯 Why BFS?

This problem is a classic case of shortest path in an unweighted grid.
Breadth-First Search guarantees the shortest path because:

It explores level by level

The first time you reach the destination, that path is the shortest

BFS avoids unnecessary paths

This makes BFS the ideal solution.

🔄 Movement Directions

These 8 directions are used:

↖  ↑  ↗
←   →  
↙  ↓  ↘


By using diagonals, we can reach the destination faster if the path is available.

🧠 Algorithm Intuition (Simple Explanation)

Start from (0, 0) with distance 1.

Use a queue to explore the grid.

Each step takes you to neighbors in 8 possible directions.

Skip blocked cells, visited cells, or out-of-bounds cells.

If we reach (n-1, n-1), immediately return path length.

If BFS finishes without reaching the end, path does not exist → return -1.

📌 Important Edge Cases

✔️ The starting cell (0,0) is blocked → return -1
✔️ The ending cell (n-1,n-1) is blocked → return -1
✔️ Grid of size 1x1

If it's 0, answer = 1

If it's 1, answer = -1
✔️ Entire grid is open → BFS finds shortest diagonal path
✔️ Grid with barriers surrounding the start or end → no solution
