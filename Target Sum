Target Sum
🔹 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.
You can assign ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign before each number in the array.
Your task is to count the number of different expressions that evaluate to the target.

📝 Example

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3  
Output: 5  
Explanation: Five ways to add and subtract to get 3  

💡 Approach – Dynamic Programming (Hash Map)

We use a dictionary to maintain:

Key → current sum
Value → number of ways to reach this sum

For each number n in nums, we create a new map to store updated sums:

Add +n

Add -n

At the end, we return number of ways to form the target.

🧠 Time & Space Complexity
Complexity	Value
⏱️ Time	O(N × S) where S = possible sum range
🧠 Space	O(S)

Efficient for typical constraints.



This problem is a variation of subset sum

We use Dynamic Programming with a hash map

Each iteration doubles the number of possible expressions
