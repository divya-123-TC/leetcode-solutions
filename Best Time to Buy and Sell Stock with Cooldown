Problem Summary

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the stock price on day `i`.

You may complete as many transactions as you like (buy and sell multiple times), but:

 After selling a stock, you must wait one day (cooldown) before buying again.

Return the maximum profit.



Approach (State-Based DP)

We track three states:

- `hold` → Maximum profit while holding a stock
- `sold` → Profit after selling a stock today
- `rest` → Profit while resting (doing nothing)

Transitions:

- `sold = hold + price`
- `hold = max(hold, rest - price)`
- `rest = max(rest, previous_sold)`

This naturally enforces the cooldown rule.

##  Time Complexity

O(n)

We iterate through prices once.

##  Space Complexity

O(1)

We use only three variables.
