Longest Increasing Subsequence 

📌 Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

A subsequence is a sequence of elements selected from the array in the same order, but not necessarily continuous.

✔ Example

Input:
nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]

Output:
4

Explanation:
The LIS is [2, 3, 7, 18] (length = 4)

🧠 Approach: Dynamic Programming

We use a DP array named LIS where:

LIS[i] = length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at index i


Initially, every element is a subsequence of length 1, so:

LIS = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]

We fill LIS from right to left (reverse order).
For each element at index i, we check all elements to its right (j > i).
If nums[i] < nums[j], we can extend the subsequence:

LIS[i] = max(LIS[i], 1 + LIS[j])

Finally, the answer is the maximum value in the LIS array.




⏱ Time & Space Complexity

Complexity	Explanation

Time: O(n²)	Two nested loops (i and j)
Space: O(n)	LIS array of size n

📚 Example Walkthrough

For nums = [4, 10, 4, 3, 8, 9]:

Index	Value	LIS Value

5	9	1
4	8	2 (8 → 9)
3	3	3 (3 → 8 → 9)
2	4	3 (4 → 8 → 9)
1	10	1
0	4	3


Answer = 3

🏁 Conclusion

The LIS problem is efficiently solved using Dynamic Programming.

We compute LIS values from right to left.

The maximum value in the LIS array gives the final answer.
