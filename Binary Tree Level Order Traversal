 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values â€” from left to right, level by level.

ðŸ”¹ Example:

Input:

3
     / \
    9  20
      /  \
     15   7

Output:

[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

ðŸ”¹ Approach:

We use Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal with a queue to visit nodes level by level:

1. Initialize an empty queue and append the root node.


2. For each level, process all nodes currently in the queue.


3. Store the values of nodes at the same level in a temporary list.


4. Add the left and right children (if present) to the queue for the next level.


5. Continue until the queue is empty.





ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(N) â†’ Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(N) â†’ Queue stores up to N nodes in the worst case.

ðŸ”¹ Key Idea:

Uses BFS traversal to visit nodes level by level using a queue.
